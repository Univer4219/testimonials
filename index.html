                          <p class="text-muted paragraph">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
                                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                              the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

                                <p class="text-muted paragraph"> Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                                    could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                                    100% recommend! ‚Äù
